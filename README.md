# RPG-rekt-simulator-2017
A turn-based RPG game that I created for my class 12th project. 
Uploaded just for documentation (storage) purposes, considered this as archived.
The code is 'updated' to work on MinGw compiler rather than the outdated Borland compiler, nothing else is changed (intentionally). It's still the same code that I wrote 4 years ago.
